# 329-Learning-Calendar
Python based application that uses Matlab mixed with the google calendar API in order to learn a users prefrences and push appropriate notifications.
# Our task:
Create a dynamic Bayes net with 5+ variables (1 must be a hidden variable about the user e.g., forgetfulness), handcraft the model variables and CPTs clearly with an explanation of the parameters, identify the inference task and which variable(s) you query, simulate the DBN by sampling it and plotting the inferred variable(s) over time to ensure the model works as expected, define a simple utility function that quantifies how good/bad each system action is depending on the state of the query variables, use a built-in inference algorithm to update your belief distribution, compute the expected utility of each system action, take the best action, incorporate this into the calendar API and demonstrate this with 3 events that will yield 3 different system actions.
